survey dbs v developers
information persistance story
it's our fault as DBAs. We are pushing developers away
We shouldn't do that.
The solution - Treat code, with cavears.
- Use existing developing processes. What ones are there.
- DB in version control
- automate, automate, automate
- How many teams you support? Integrate with them.
Process
 - define, write it down. Use story of deployments happening often. Get management to buy in.
 - exceptions are exceptional
Development Process
- This is how developers view the process
Deployment
- this is the reverse

Demos
VCS
 - emphasize multiple ways to use VCS, but use it
 - add feed to the system.
 - Make changes to the articles
 - where is the vcs on disk? I don't have that.
